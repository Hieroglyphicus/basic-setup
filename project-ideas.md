## Place you can write all your ideas
Use the simple bulleting or numbering with short description.

1) *Store the data about Gardiner glyphs separated by MdC stacking commands* (e.g. "D46:Q3\*X1-P1"). These stacking commands are not obtrusive and can easily be parsed away using a regex. However, they contain very valuable data about how the glyphs are stacked, which will be useful in the future, if we want to implement an MdC parser or let users easily copy and paste entire words into JSesh or other MdC based hieroglyphic text processors. Which stacking order should we follow? The one from Erman and Grapow - it is good enough for all practical purposes.
